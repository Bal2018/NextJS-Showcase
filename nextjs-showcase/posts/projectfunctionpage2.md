 I enrolled in Project Function (a weekly coding course) which focussed on learning web development and design. Here I learnt how to structure my web pages using HTML, to style them using CSS and was introduced to JavaScript, the building blocks of web pages. The course consisted of numerous <a href="https://github.com/Bal2018/projectfn-challenges" target="_blank">challenges </a> to be completed.
 
After completing the course I felt so empowered with my experience that I decided to give back to the community and applied to become an Instructor.
