 I enrolled in Project Function (a weekly coding course) which focussed on learning web development and design. Here I learnt how to structure my web pages using HTML, to style them using CSS and was introduced to JavaScript, the building blocks of web pages. The course consisted of numerous <a href="https://github.com/Bal2018/projectfn-challenges" target="_blank">challenges </a> to be completed.
 
After completing the course I felt so empowered with my experience that I decided to give back to the community and applied and become an Instructor here.

One of the reasons ProjectFunction is so successful is because it is taught by a small team of people who understand the challenges faced by marginalised people (women, under represented groups in society) today.  The diversity of the team represents the groups we are trying to teach by understanding the day-to-day challenges faced by them.

As an instructor I was also able to bring in my teaching experience to enable the best possible experience for these candidates.
