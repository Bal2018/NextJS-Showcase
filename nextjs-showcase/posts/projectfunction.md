 I enrolled in Project Function (a weekly coding course) which focussed on learning web development (HTML, CSS and Java-script) and PHP basics.  I produced a sample PHP website to showcase my skills and projects.
 I am now an instructor with this voluntary organisation and we are trying to transfer to an online learning platform due to Covid.
