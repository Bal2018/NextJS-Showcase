I am a Computer Science graduate who worked as a programmer before moving into the teaching sector. I rekindled my passion for technology a few years ago and am now looking for more challenges and exciting projects to work on. I have the ability and  skill set to plan and present complicated ideas simply and am comfortable in explaining logical complex problems.
Outside of work I am now co-organiser of  <a href="https://phpminds.org/" target="_blank">PHPMinds </a> and also attend other Tech meet-ups such as <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Women-In-Tech-Nottingham/" target="_blank">Women In Tech</a> and <a href="https://www.technottingham.com/" target="_blank">Tech Nottingham</a> .
 
 I have completed a 12 week course with  <a href="https://www.projectfunction.io/" target="_blank">Project Function</a> and am now an Instructor with this voluntary organisation. I have also successfully completed and passed a 6-month course with <a href="https://https://techupwomen.org/" target="_blank">Tech-Up Women</a> which brought me up to speed with the latest in Tech industry. This course was affiliated with Durham University,  Nottingham University, York University and Edgehill University.  I completed the Business Analysis foundation certification.

For the past year I have worked as a junior developer at JH - a small web-agency in Nottingham. 
I am now looking to broaden my horizons and looking for a more challenging adventure.
