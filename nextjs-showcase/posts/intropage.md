I am a Computer Science graduate with years of working knowledge of programming fundamentals before I retrained and moved into the teaching sector.  After spending over a decade in teaching I rekindled my passion for technology and am now looking to work in  this dynamic and exciting IT industry with new, fast-paced and challenging projects. 

As a Mathematics Teachers and Tutor I have excellent IT and analytical skills.  I have the ability and  skill set to plan and present complicated ideas simply.  Used to explaining logical complex problems  Regular attendee to a number of local tech meet-ups and events such as <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Women-In-Tech-Nottingham/" target="_blank">Women In Tech</a>,  <a href="https://phpminds.org/" target="_blank">PHP Nottingham </a>
and <a href="https://www.technottingham.com/" target="_blank">Tech Nottingham</a>

For the past year I have worked as a junior developer at JH - a small web-agency in Nottingham.  I am now looking to broaden my horizon and looking for a more challenging adventure.
