 As I had been out of the IT industry for a number of years I decided that the best way forward was to do a “work experience” placement.  I was fortunate to have secured a number of weeks at DVSA in Nottingham.  This is part of the civil service and is such an exciting and dynamic place to work.  I had exposure to PHP programming and the Agile working environment.  This was a  fantastic opportunity that allowed me to decide that this was indeed the career I wanted.
