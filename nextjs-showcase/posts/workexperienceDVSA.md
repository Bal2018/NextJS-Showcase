 As part of my reintroduction to IT, I visited the DVSA offices in Nottingham.  This is part of the civil service and is such an exciting and dynamic place to work.  I had exposure to PHP programming and the Agile working environment.  
 Being able to see the current IT sector I was inspired and confident I had made the correct choice to change careers.
