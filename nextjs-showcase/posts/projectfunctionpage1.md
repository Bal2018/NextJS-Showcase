  Project Function is a voluntarily organisation set up to provide the skills and confidence to allow minorities to get into the Tech industry.  This is one of the goals and to achieve this the course is taught by a small team of developers who understand the challenges faced by under-represented groups in society today.  

As an instructor I am able to bring in my teaching experience to enable the best possible experience for these candidates.
